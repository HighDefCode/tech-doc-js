        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
          <br><li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
          </li>
        </ol>

          <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
          <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
          <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

      <header>What the <i>heck</i> is Camel Case?</header>
      <article>
        <p>Camel case, or "camelCase," is a way of writing phrases without spaces, where the first letter of each word is capitalized, <strong>except</strong> for the first letter of the entire compound word, which is typically lower case. The name comes from the similarity of the capital letters to the humps of a camel's back. It's often stylized as "camelCase" to remind the reader of its appearance.</p>
        <p>When the first letter of the entire phrase is upper case, it is called <i>upper camel case</i> or <i>Pascal case</i>. Otherwise, it is referred to as <i>lower camel case</i> or just <i>camelCase</i>. Camel case is the most popular convention in JavaScript, Java, and various other programming languages.</p>

        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript ... it's fairly easy: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use your mouse to select the text below</li>
          <li>Right-click the selection and left-click "copy"</li>
          <li>Right-click again on some text on this page and click "inspect" (at the very bottom) of the menu</li>
          <li>This will open Google Dev Tools;</li>
          <li>At the top left-side of Dev Tools, click <i>Console</i> - to the right of <i>Elements</i></li>
          <li>Right-click the blicking cursor and click paste</li>
          <li>OILA! Your first JS Code ... bravo!</li>
        </ul>
        <p><code>
          function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");
        </code></p>
        <p>If you like math or even if you're not afraid of math, you'll love JS. </p>

      <header>Variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
        <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
      <header>Declaring Variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
          With the keyword <i>var</i>.</p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <p><code>
            var x = 42;
          </code></p>
          <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.

            By simply assigning it a value.</p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <p><code>
            x = 42;
          </code></p>
          <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
          <p>Instead, use the keyword <i>let</i>. For example,</p>
            <p><code>
              let x = 42;
            </code></p>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. </p>
            <p>And So On...</p>
            <p>Click the <strong>"Try Me"</strong> button below to see a javaScript alert box (notice we used <i>camelCase</i> for "javaScript").</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Here's the javaScript that makes this happen:</p>
            <p><code>
              function myFunction() { alert("Hello\nHow are you?");}
            </code></p>
            <button class="button" role="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try Me</button>
              <script>
                function myFunction() {
                alert("Hello\nHow are you?");
                }
              </script>
              <p>When you see the box, click "OK"</p>
